I'm currently,
- 📚 working on self-supervised action abstractions, skill discovery, and symbolic representation learning for reinforcement learning and robotics
- 🖼️ finalizing my project on *Building Visual Semantic Bias in Curious Exploration during Free Play*
- 🚀 preparing to release my fNIRS data analysis pipeline library — [fnirsPy](https://github.com/pulkitgoyal56/)

I recently,  
- 🧠 finished a research internship at the Cognitive Neurorobotics Unit at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan
  - I was working on using variational bayesian techniques from RL, the Free Energy Principle, and Active Inference to develop a computational model of OCD
- 📖 finished my Master's in Neural Information Processing from the University of Tübingen

<!-- DONE -->
