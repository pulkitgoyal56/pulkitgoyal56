I'm currently,
- 📚 reading about abstraction and learning symbolic representation in reinforcement learning
- 🖼️ finalizing my project on *Building Visual Semantic Bias in Curious Exploration during Free Play*
- 🚀 preparing to release my fNIRS data analysis pipeline library — [fnirsPy](https://github.com/pulkitgoyal56/)

I recently,
